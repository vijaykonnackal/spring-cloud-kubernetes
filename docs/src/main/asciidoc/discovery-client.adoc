== DiscoveryClient for Kubernetes

This project provides an implementation of https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/blob/master/spring-cloud-commons/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/client/discovery/DiscoveryClient.java[Discovery Client]
for https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes].
This client lets you query Kubernetes endpoints (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/[services]) by name.
A service is typically exposed by the Kubernetes API server as a collection of endpoints that represent `http` and `https` addresses and that a client can
access from a Spring Boot application running as a pod. This discovery feature is also used by the Spring Cloud Kubernetes Ribbon project
to fetch the list of the endpoints defined for an application to be load balanced.

This is something that you get for free by adding the following dependency inside your project:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
====

To enable loading of the `DiscoveryClient`, add `@EnableDiscoveryClient` to the according configuration or application class, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class Application {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }
}
----
====

Then you can inject the client in your code simply by autowiring it, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;
----
====

You can choose to enable `DiscoveryClient` from all namespaces by setting the following property in `application.properties`:

====
[source]
----
spring.cloud.kubernetes.discovery.all-namespaces=true
----
====

If, for any reason, you need to disable the `DiscoveryClient`, you can set the following property in `application.properties`:

====
[source]
----
spring.cloud.kubernetes.discovery.enabled=false
----
====

Some Spring Cloud components use the `DiscoveryClient` in order to obtain information about the local service instance. For
this to work, you need to align the Kubernetes service name with the `spring.application.name` property.

NOTE:  `spring.application.name` has no effect as far as the name registered for the application within Kubernetes

Spring Cloud Kubernetes can also watch the Kubernetes service catalog for changes and update the
`DiscoveryClient` implementation accordingly.  In order to enable this functionality you need to add
`@EnableScheduling` on a configuration class in your application.
